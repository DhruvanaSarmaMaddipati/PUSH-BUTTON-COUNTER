PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

PUSHBUTTON COUNTER
Description of task:
Simple embedded system to count how many times a push button is pressed, using an Arduino. The result is shown on the Serial Monitor.

Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Push Button
- 10kÎ© Resistor
- Jumper wires
  
How It Works
- Each button press increases the counter by one.
- Includes debouncing for reliable counting.
- Count is displayed on Serial Monitor.
- 
circuit connection:
connected 1b of push button to digital pin 2 of arduino ide
10kohm resisttor one end to 1a terminal of push button and other end to ground
2a termianal of pushbutton to 5v of arduino

How I Run
1. Upload code using Arduino IDE
2. Open Serial Monitor at 9600 baud
3. Press button to see count
   
output:
BUtton Counter Ready
Button Pressed. Count = 1
Button Pressed. Count = 2....
